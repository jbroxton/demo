# Data Model

## Overview
This document outlines the data model for the application, focusing on the hierarchical relationship between Products, Interfaces, Features, and Releases.

## Hierarchical Structure
The application follows a top-down hierarchical model:

```
Product > Interface > Feature > Release
```

## Entity Descriptions

### Product
The top-level entity representing a product offering.

Attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Product name
- `description`: Product description
- `interfaces`: Array of Interface IDs belonging to this product

### Interface
A major section or area of a product.

Attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Interface name
- `description`: Interface description
- `productId`: ID of the parent product
- `features`: Array of Feature IDs belonging to this interface

### Feature
A specific capability or function within an interface.

Attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Feature name
- `description`: Feature description
- `priority`: Priority level (High, Med, Low)
- `interfaceId`: ID of the parent interface
- `releases`: Array of Release IDs belonging to this feature
- `artifacts`: Optional array of artifact references

### Release
A specific version or milestone for a feature.

Attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Release name
- `description`: Release description
- `releaseDate`: Planned or actual release date
- `priority`: Priority level (High, Med, Low)
- `featureId`: ID of the parent feature

## Relationships

1. A Product contains multiple Interfaces
2. An Interface belongs to a single Product and contains multiple Features
3. A Feature belongs to a single Interface and contains multiple Releases
4. A Release belongs to a single Feature

## State Management
All entities are managed using Zustand stores with local storage persistence.
