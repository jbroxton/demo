#Create a new feauture
Allows the Product Manager (user) to add a new feature to specky. 

# V1
Click path
1. User clicks the new feature button in the side nav
2. new feature drawer opens
3. User inputs data
4. User clicks save
5. the new feature is added to the features table for the user
6. The new feature is visible in the Features list (used to be files) in the side nav
6. Release will be worked out later - skip for now to the features and shows up in the side nav. 

Data Model
Feature Details
- ID (auto assigned)
- Name (required)
- Priority (High, Med, Low)
- Description (long text field)
- Product Name (text field)
- ReleaseID (auto assigned)
- Artifacts (links)

A Feature has a 1:n relationship with Release. 
A Feature has a 1:n relationship with Artifacts. 

Data Storage
- All data will be stored client-side based on Ruled.md
- Use Zustand store with localStorage persistence (following existing auth pattern)
- Create a basic features store with add/get functionality

Release
- ID (auto assigned)
- Name: (required)
- Release Date: 
- Priority: (High, Med, Low)
- Feature ID
- Release Stage (sorted by release date)
- Artifacts  

A Release has a 1:n relationship with Artifacts. 
Defer Artifacts and Release connections for later iterations



Side Nav
- Features appear in the side nav in the content section
- Rename "Files" to Features
- Features are containers that contain releases

UI Updates
- Render features in the sidebar after creation
Update the sidebar to replace "Files" with "Features" section
The drawer already has most of the UI elements needed (dont make if ones if they already exist)

Implementation Steps:
Create src/stores/features.ts for state management
Update the drawer form in app-sidebar.tsx to match requirements
Implement form submission handling
Update sidebar navigation to display features instead of files


#Constrians
- Rules.md
- Themes.md
- When implementing the feature, do not make extra changes. Just do the lease to get the feature working, so as not to grow the codebase too fast. 

#Notes
- This basic implementation focuses on the "C" in CRUD, allowing users to create features while deferring the Read, Update, Delete functionality for later as suggested. The form is already in place in the drawer component; we just need to tailor it to the feature data model and implement the storage and display logic.


We need to update the feature page.
- Change the feature drawer to upon in the page within a tab
- the page consists of two parts
    - A text editor
    - A details panel

# V2
- For V2 we just needd to make a tab open if New feature is clicked or an existing feature is clicked
- When the tab is open I want the user to see a text editor with a pre poulated field called New Feature 
 
## Implementation Steps for V2

1. **Create Text Editor Component Using React Quill**
   - Use React Quill for a simple yet enhanced text editing experience
   - Install the package: `npm install react-quill`
   - Create a new component in src/components/feature-editor.tsx
   - Configure with minimal toolbar options for basic formatting
   - Add autofocus for immediate typing when the tab opens

2. **Setup Feature Tab Content**
   - Create a component that renders when a feature tab is selected
   - Include the React Quill editor as the main content
   - Add a simple save button below the editor
   - Create this component in src/components/feature-tab-content.tsx
   - Layout should be responsive and fill the available tab content area

3. **Connect to Feature Store**
   - Update the feature store to include a "content" field for text
   - Add a function to save editor content to the feature's data
   - Load existing content when opening an existing feature
   - Modify src/stores/features.ts to add the content field and update functions
   - Example structure: { id, name, priority, description, content, ... }

4. **Implement Tab Navigation Logic**
   - Ensure clicking "New Feature" or an existing feature opens a tab
   - Pre-populate with "New Feature" text for new features
   - Show existing content for previously saved features
   - Modify the handleAddFeature and handleFeatureClick functions in app-sidebar.tsx
   - Update the tab store to include content information

5. **Add Save Functionality**
   - Implement a save button that persists editor content
   - Add visual feedback when content is saved
   - Ensure content persists between tab switches
   - Add a saveFeatureContent function to the features store
   - Use a simple toast or status indicator for save confirmation

6. **Basic Styling**
   - Import React Quill default styles and customize as needed
   - Ensure the editor fills the available space
   - Set appropriate height and padding
   - Match the existing application theme
   - Minimum height should be 300px

## Implementation Notes for V2

### Implementation Summary
We've successfully implemented a text editor for features using React Quill, which provides a lightweight and easy-to-use rich text editing experience. The implementation includes:

1. **React Quill Integration**
   - Switched from react-quill to react-quill-new to fix the "react_dom_1.default.findDOMNode is not a function" error in React 19
   - Used Next.js dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` to prevent "document is not defined" errors during server-side rendering
   - Added client-side only rendering with proper loading states
   - Installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle React 19 compatibility
   - Configured minimal formatting options (bold, italic, underline)
   - Added custom CSS to ensure proper rendering in the dark theme

2. **Feature Content Management**
   - Added a `content` field to the Feature interface in the features store
   - Implemented `saveFeatureContent` function to persist editor content
   - Added visual feedback for save operations (saving, saved, error states)

3. **UI Components Created**
   - `FeatureEditor`: A reusable component that handles the editing experience
   - `FeatureTabContent`: A wrapper that displays feature metadata and the editor
   - Created a custom hook `useQuill` to safely load React Quill on the client side

4. **Tab System Integration**
   - Updated `TabContent` to use the new `FeatureTabContent` for feature tabs
   - Maintained existing tab navigation behavior
   - Added client-side detection to prevent hydration errors

### Potential Improvements for Future Iterations
1. Add autosave functionality to reduce manual saves
2. Implement content versioning to track changes
3. Expand formatting options based on user feedback
4. Add collaboration features (comments, shared editing)

### Known Limitations
1. Using react-quill-new instead of react-quill since the original package is not compatible with React 19
2. React Quill only works on the client side and requires special handling for Next.js server components
3. Content is stored in localStorage, which has size limitations
4. No offline editing capabilities with automatic sync

### Usage Instructions
To edit a feature's content:
1. Click on a feature in the sidebar to open its tab
2. Use the editor to add or modify content
3. Click "Save Changes" to persist your work
4. The save status will be displayed below the editor

# V3
Make the Feature Name Fields Editable in all places:
  1. The tab in the editor
  2. The top of the document 
  3. The nested tree in sidebar
- All name fields should be in sync when updated
- Auto-save the new name when a user enters the name and clicks out

## Implementation Plan for V3

1. **Update Feature Store**
   - Add a `updateFeatureName` function to the features store
   - Ensure this function triggers necessary UI updates across components
   - Implement optimistic updates for a responsive user experience

2. **Make Tab Names Editable**
   - Update `TabsTrigger` component to include an editable name field
   - Add blur and keyboard (Enter key) event handlers to save changes
   - Ensure tab names update immediately upon save
   - Update the tab store to handle name changes

3. **Make Feature Header Editable**
   - Update the heading in `FeatureTabContent` to be an editable field
   - Style it to match the current design when not in edit mode
   - Add visual indication when editing is active
   - Implement auto-save on blur or Enter key press

4. **Update Sidebar Tree**
   - Modify the feature tree item component to support inline editing
   - Ensure edits in the sidebar sync with tabs and header
   - Add click-to-edit functionality with appropriate UI cues
   - Maintain current tree structure and nesting during edits

5. **Implement Synchronized State**
   - Ensure all components listen to the same store for feature name changes
   - Implement proper error handling for failed updates
   - Add loading/saving indicators where appropriate
   - Create utility functions for consistent name formatting

6. **Add User Experience Enhancements**
   - Include subtle animations for edit state transitions
   - Add validation to prevent empty or duplicate names
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for quick editing
   - Ensure focus management follows a natural flow

## Technical Approach

1. **State Management**
   - Use the existing Zustand store as the single source of truth
   - Implement a publish/subscribe pattern for name change events
   - Optimize for minimal re-renders when names change

2. **Component Updates**
   - Create a reusable `EditableText` component for consistent behavior
   - Use controlled inputs with local state for editing experience
   - Ensure all editable fields have consistent styling and behavior

3. **Auto-Save Mechanism**
   - Implement debounced auto-save to prevent excessive updates
   - Add visual feedback during and after save operations
   - Handle error states gracefully with appropriate user feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Users can edit feature names by clicking on them in any of the three locations
- ✅ Name changes are immediately reflected in all three places:
  - In the tab name
  - In the feature header
  - In the sidebar tree
- ✅ Names automatically save when the user clicks away or presses Enter

1. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Added `updateFeatureName` function to the features store for centralized name updates
   - Implemented `updateTabTitle` function in the tabs store to keep tab titles in sync
   - Used existing localStorage persistence for name persistence across sessions

2. **UI Updates for Editable Fields**
   - Made feature names editable in three key locations:
     - The feature tab title in the tab bar
     - The feature header in the feature content area
     - The feature name in the sidebar tree
   - Used existing UI components (Input) from the shadcn/UI library
   - Implemented consistent editing experience across all locations

3. **Synchronization System**

   - Prevented empty names from being saved

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Added edit indicators with pencil icons for better discoverability
   - Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
   - Added auto-save on blur (clicking away)
   - Maintained focus management for a smooth editing experience

### Technical Details

1. **Store Updates**
   - The `updateFeatureName` function in the features store now serves as the single source of truth
   - The `updateTabTitle` function in the tabs store keeps tabs in sync with feature name changes
   - Both functions validate input to prevent empty names

2. **Component Implementation**
   - All three locations use controlled inputs with local state for editing
   - Edit mode is toggled with a dedicated state variable
   - Auto-save is triggered on blur events or Enter key press
   - All inputs maintain appropriate styling consistent with the application theme

3. **Event Handling**
   - Implemented proper event propagation control to prevent unintended side effects
   - Used `stopPropagation()` to ensure clicking edit buttons doesn't trigger other actions
   - Managed focus correctly with refs to auto-focus inputs when editing starts

4. **Fixed Hydration Error with Nested Buttons**
   - Fixed a potential hydration error caused by nested `<button>` elements in sidebar tree items
   - Replaced `<button>` elements inside `SidebarMenuButton` (which is a button) with `<span>` elements
   - Added appropriate accessibility attributes (`role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`) to maintain functionality
   - Used consistent styling to preserve the visual appearance
   - This prevents HTML validation errors and potential hydration mismatches between server and client rendering

### Lessons Learned

1. **State Synchronization Patterns**
   - Using a central store as the single source of truth simplifies synchronization
   - Updating all UI elements from a single update function ensures consistency
   - Local component state for editing provides better user experience

2. **Working with Pre-built Components**
   - Shadcn/UI components were easily adapted for inline editing scenarios

# V5

## Goal
Improve the UI/UX of the edit functionality in the sidebar by only showing the edit pencil icon when hovering over the specific entity it belongs to, rather than showing all edit pencils when any entity in the sidebar is hovered.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Edit pencil icons only appear when hovering over their specific entity item
- No edit pencils appear when hovering over parent containers or neighboring items
- Edit pencil visibility transitions are smooth with appropriate animation
- The behavior is consistent across Products, Interfaces, and Features
- The implementation preserves all existing V4 functionality
- Only pre-built components are used in implementation. No custom components
- No bugs exist
- App is fully functional
- Implementation notes are updated with learnings and best practices

## Implementation Plan for V5

1. **Update CSS Classes and Hover Logic**
   - Modify the hover classes for sidebar tree items to use more specific selectors
   - Replace the current group hover approach with individual item hover detection
   - Update CSS classes to control pencil icon visibility for each specific item
   - Ensure transitions remain smooth with appropriate opacity animations

2. **Refine Component Structure**
   - Ensure each tree item has its own isolated hover state
   - Adjust the structure of nested components if needed to prevent hover propagation
   - Apply hover effects only to the specific item being hovered, not its children or siblings

3. **Consistent Implementation Across Entity Types**
   - Apply the same hover pattern to all three entity types:
     - ProductTreeItem
     - InterfaceTreeItem
     - FeatureTreeItem
   - Ensure consistent behavior and visual appearance across all entity types

4. **Testing Focus Areas**
   - Verify edit pencils only appear for the exact item being hovered
   - Test deeply nested structures to ensure hover states don't propagate incorrectly
   - Check that hover behavior is consistent across different entity types
   - Ensure existing functionality (clicking edit buttons, context menus) continues to work

## Technical Approach

1. **CSS Strategy**
   - Use individual hover states instead of group hover
   - Implement more specific CSS selectors to target only the hovered item
   - Replace `group-hover:opacity-50` classes with direct `:hover` selectors
   - Maintain transition effects for smooth appearance/disappearance

2. **Component Structure Review**
   - Review the current component structure to identify potential hover propagation issues
   - Adjust container and wrapper elements if necessary to isolate hover effects
   - Consider using stopPropagation for mouse events if CSS changes aren't sufficient

3. **Implementation Process**
   - Start with one entity type to establish the pattern
   - Test thoroughly before applying to other entity types
   - Apply the same pattern consistently across all entity types
   - Review animation and transition effects for smoothness

# V10

## Goal
Update the user flow for creating entities (Products, Interfaces, Features) by removing the drawer implementation and instead opening a new default state tab in the dashboard when a user chooses to create a new entity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can create a new Product through a tab-based interface rather than a drawer
- Users can create a new Interface through a tab-based interface rather than a drawer
- Users can create a new Feature through a tab-based interface rather than a drawer
- The existing drawer implementation is completely removed
- The User Story can be completed with no bugs
- App is functional after feature is implemented
- Implementation only uses pre-built components
- Implementation notes are created with best practices and learnings

## Implementation Plan for V10

1. **Understand the Current Implementation**
   - Review how entities are currently created using the drawer implementation
   - Identify all components and code related to the drawer that will need to be removed
   - Map out the flow from "Add New" button click to entity creation completion

2. **Create New Default Tab Content Components**
   - Create or update component for a new default Product tab with:
     - Name: "New Product" (editable)
     - Description field (editable)
     - Interfaces section showing "No interfaces connected" when empty
   - Create or update component for a new default Interface tab with:
     - Name: "New Interface" (editable)
     - Description field (editable)
     - Parent Product field (selectable)
     - Features section showing "No features connected" when empty
   - Create or update component for a new default Feature tab with:
     - Name: "New Feature" (editable)
     - Description field (editable)
     - Parent Interface field (selectable)

3. **Update Tab Opening Logic**
   - Modify the logic in the "Add New" button handler to create and open a new tab instead of opening the drawer
   - Adjust the flow so that after entity type selection in the dialog, a new tab opens with the default state
   - Update sidebar context menu add actions to open a new tab with the proper parent entity pre-selected

4. **Update Store Functions**
   - Modify the entity creation functions in the respective stores (Product, Interface, Feature) to work with the new tab-based flow
   - Add functions to handle creating entities directly from the tab content
   - Ensure all state updates work correctly when a new entity is saved

5. **Remove Drawer Implementation**
   - Remove the drawer component and related code
   - Clean up any unused imports, functions, and variables related to the drawer
   - Make sure all references to the drawer are removed to prevent bugs

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test the complete flow of creating each entity type through the new tab interface
   - Verify that parent-child relationships are correctly established during creation
   - Ensure existing entities remain functional and don't experience any regressions
   - Test edge cases such as cancelling creation, validation errors, etc.

## Technical Approach

1. **Tab-Based Entity Creation**
   - Use existing TabContent and tab-specific content components
   - Add a "isNew" state flag to distinguish between new and existing entities
   - Implement a save button for new entity tabs with appropriate validation

2. **Form Implementation**
   - Reuse the existing form fields from the drawer but integrate them into the tab content
   - Maintain consistency with the existing editing experience for entity names and descriptions
   - Ensure all editable fields have proper validation

3. **Entity Selection for Parent-Child Relationships**
   - Implement dropdowns or similar selection UI for choosing parent entities
   - Handle edge cases like no available parent entities
   - Pre-select parent entities when adding a child through context menus

4. **State Management**
   - Use Zustand stores for state management, following the existing pattern
   - Update tabs store to handle special cases for unsaved new entities
   - Ensure cancellation properly cleans up any temporary state

5. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove all drawer-related code and imports
   - Document removed code sections to ensure they are fully understood
   - Refactor any shared functionality to be reusable between different entity types

## Implementation Steps

1. Create new versions of the tab content components with "new entity" mode
2. Update the state management to support creating new entities from tabs
3. Modify the "Add New" button and dialog to open tabs instead of drawers
4. Update the add functionality in the sidebar context menus
5. Test all creation flows thoroughly
6. Remove the drawer implementation completely
7. Final testing and validation
8. Update documentation with implementation notes

# V11

## Issue
Currently, there are inconsistencies between the "New Feature" page and the saved feature view:
1. The "New Feature" page shows a form with a standard textarea for description and a separate content section with React Quill
2. The saved feature view has a different layout and handling of content
3. This creates a jarring user experience when transitioning between states

## Requirements
1. Make both the "New Feature" page and saved feature views consistent with the same UI elements
2. Replace the description textarea with React Quill for rich text editing
3. Remove the separate content section entirely (as shown in the screenshots)
4. Preserve all existing functionality for editing feature names, priorities, etc.
5. Ensure descriptions persist across sessions using the existing SQLite storage

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Sequence
To ensure a smooth implementation, we'll follow these steps in order:

1. **Update Feature Store**: Add the `updateFeatureDescription` method first to establish the data persistence foundation
2. **Create FeatureDescriptionEditor Component**: Implement the reusable React Quill editor component 
3. **Add CSS Styles**: Define styles for the React Quill editor to match the app's dark theme
4. **Update FeatureTabContent Component**: Modify the component to use the new editor and remove the content section
5. **Implement Migration Utility**: Create the utility to migrate existing content to the description field

Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring we establish the data layer before creating UI components.

### Step 1: Create FeatureDescriptionEditor Component

Create a reusable React Quill editor specifically for descriptions:

```typescript
// src/components/feature-description-editor.tsx
import React from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import { useQuill } from '@/hooks/use-quill';

// Dynamically import ReactQuill with ssr disabled
const ReactQuill = dynamic(
  () => import('react-quill-new'),
  { ssr: false }
);

interface FeatureDescriptionEditorProps {
  initialContent: string;
  onChange: (content: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  readOnly?: boolean;
}

export function FeatureDescriptionEditor({
  initialContent,
  onChange,
  placeholder = 'Enter feature description...',
  readOnly = false
}: FeatureDescriptionEditorProps) {
  const { isQuillLoaded } = useQuill();
  
  // Quill modules configuration - minimal toolbar
  const modules = {
    toolbar: readOnly ? false : [
      ['bold', 'italic', 'underline'],
      ['clean'] // Remove formatting button
    ]
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="min-h-[150px]">
      {typeof window !== 'undefined' && isQuillLoaded ? (
        <ReactQuill
          theme="snow"
          value={initialContent}
          onChange={onChange}
          modules={modules}
          placeholder={placeholder}
          readOnly={readOnly}
          className="h-full text-white quill-editor"
        />
      ) : (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
          <div className="text-[#a0a0a0]">Loading editor...</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Update Feature Store

Add a method to update feature descriptions and remove content related code. The method will update the description in the SQLite database through the existing hybrid storage adapter:

```typescript
// In src/stores/features.ts

// 1. Update Feature type to mark content as optional (will be removed in the future)
export type Feature = {
  id: string
  name: string
  priority: 'High' | 'Med' | 'Low'
  description: string // This will now store rich text HTML
  interfaceId: string
  content?: string // Mark as optional for migration
  releases?: string[]
  artifacts?: string[]
}

// 2. Add a method to update feature descriptions
updateFeatureDescription: (featureId: string, description: string) => {
  // Don't update if description is empty
  if (!description.trim()) return;
  
  set((state) => ({
    features: state.features.map(feature => 
      feature.id === featureId 
        ? { ...feature, description: description.trim() } 
        : feature
    )
  }))
  // The updated state will be automatically persisted to SQLite
  // through the existing hybrid storage adapter
}
```

### Step 3: Modify FeatureTabContent Component

Update the component to use React Quill for descriptions in both new and view modes:

```typescript
// src/components/feature-tab-content.tsx

// 1. Import the new component
import { FeatureDescriptionEditor } from './feature-description-editor';

export function FeatureTabContent({ 
  featureId, 
  isNew = false,
  selectedInterfaceId 
}: FeatureTabContentProps) {
  // 2. Add state for description editing
  const { 
    getFeatureById, 
    updateFeatureName, 
    updateFeatureDescription, // New method
    addFeature, 
    getFeaturesByInterfaceId 
  } = useFeaturesStore();
  
  // 3. Add state for description editing
  const [isDescriptionEditing, setIsDescriptionEditing] = useState(false);
  
  // 4. Remove contentValue state variable and keep all others
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(isNew);
  const [nameValue, setNameValue] = useState(isNew ? 'New Feature' : '');
  const [descriptionValue, setDescriptionValue] = useState('');
  const [priorityValue, setPriorityValue] = useState<'High' | 'Med' | 'Low'>('Med');
  const [interfaceId, setInterfaceId] = useState(selectedInterfaceId || '');
  const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);
  
  // 5. Add handler for saving description
  const handleDescriptionSave = () => {
    if (!isNew && feature) {
      updateFeatureDescription(featureId, descriptionValue);
      setIsDescriptionEditing(false);
    }
  };
  
  // 6. Update handleSaveFeature to remove content
  const handleSaveFeature = async () => {
    if (!nameValue.trim() || !interfaceId) {
      return;
    }
    
    setIsSaving(true);
    
    try {
      // Create new feature without content field
      await addFeature({
        name: nameValue.trim(),
        description: descriptionValue, // This now contains HTML
        priority: priorityValue,
        interfaceId: interfaceId
      });
      
      // Rest of the function remains the same
      const interfaceFeatures = getFeaturesByInterfaceId(interfaceId) || [];
      if (interfaceFeatures.length > 0) {
        const newFeatureId = interfaceFeatures[interfaceFeatures.length - 1].id;
        updateInterfaceWithFeature(interfaceId, newFeatureId);
      }
      
      const currentTab = tabs.find(tab => tab.id === featureId);
      if (currentTab) {
        closeTab(currentTab.id);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to save feature:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsSaving(false);
    }
  };
  
  // 7. Modify the JSX for the New Feature form
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full bg-[#1e1e20]">
      {/* Feature name and priority section remains the same */}
      
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden p-4">

                        onChange={(value) => setDescriptionValue(value)}
                      />
                      <div className="mt-2 flex justify-end">
                        <Button 
                          onClick={handleDescriptionSave}

                    </div>
                  ) : (
                    <div 
                      className="prose prose-invert max-w-none cursor-pointer hover:bg-[#232326] px-2 py-1 rounded-md flex items-start"

                      <div 
                        className="flex-1"

                </div>
                
                <div>
                  <p className="text-[#a0a0a0] text-sm mb-1">Interface</p>
                  <p>{selectedInterface ? selectedInterface.name : "No interface selected"}</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          )
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Update CSS

Add some custom styles for the React Quill editor to ensure it fits the dark theme:

```css
/* Add to global.css */
.quill-editor .ql-container {
  border-color: #2a2a2c;
  background-color: #232326;
  color: white;
  min-height: 150px;
}

.quill-editor .ql-toolbar {
  border-color: #2a2a2c;
  background-color: #1e1e20;
  color: white;
}

.quill-editor .ql-stroke {
  stroke: #a0a0a0;
}

.quill-editor .ql-fill {
  fill: #a0a0a0;
}

.quill-editor .ql-picker {
  color: #a0a0a0;
}

.quill-editor .ql-editor.ql-blank::before {
  color: #575757;
}
```

### Step 5: Migrate Existing Features

Create a migration utility to handle existing features with content. The migration will update the SQLite database through the existing hybrid storage adapter:

```typescript
// src/utils/migrate-features.ts
import { useFeaturesStore } from '@/stores/features';

export function migrateFeatures() {
  const { features, updateFeatureDescription } = useFeaturesStore.getState();
  
  // Process each feature that has content
  features.forEach(feature => {
    if (feature.content && feature.content.trim()) {
      // If description is empty, just move content to description
      if (!feature.description || feature.description.trim() === '') {
        updateFeatureDescription(feature.id, feature.content);
      } else {
        // If both exist, append content to description with a separator
        const updatedDescription = `${feature.description}<hr /><div class="mt-4">${feature.content}</div>`;
        updateFeatureDescription(feature.id, updatedDescription);
      }
    }
  });
  
  console.log('Feature migration complete');
}
```

Run this migration when the app starts:

```typescript
// In pages/_app.tsx or a similar component that runs on startup
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    // Run migration after a delay to ensure stores are loaded
    setTimeout(() => {
      migrateFeatures();
    }, 1000);
  }
}, []);
```

## Data Persistence Notes

- All feature descriptions will be stored in the SQLite database through the existing hybrid storage adapter
- The Features store already uses SQLite for persistent storage across sessions (implemented in V3)
- The `updateFeatureDescription` method in the features store ensures that descriptions are stored in the SQLite database

# V12: Fix Feature Creation and Tab Update Flow

## Issue
Currently, there are issues with the feature creation and update flow in the tab interface:
1. When a user creates a new feature and clicks "Save Feature," the tab doesn't update to show the newly created feature's name/details
2. If a user tries to change the name of a recently created feature, the system erroneously creates another new feature instead of updating the existing one
3. This creates confusion in the user interface and leads to duplicate features

## Requirements
1. Ensure the tab updates properly after saving a new feature to show the newly created feature details
2. Fix the issue where editing a newly created feature creates a duplicate instead of updating
3. Maintain a consistent user experience for feature creation and editing
4. Ensure SQLite persistence continues to work correctly
5. Preserve all existing V11 functionality

## Implementation Plan (Refined)

This plan focuses on a clean state transition managed through the stores and props, addressing the core issues identified.

### Implementation Sequence
The sequence remains logical, focusing on store updates first, then component logic:

1.  **Implement `updateNewTabToSavedItem` in `useTabsStore`**: Establish the core mechanism for transitioning a temporary tab to a persistent one.
2.  **Refine `handleSaveFeature` in `FeatureTabContent`**: Modify the save logic to use the new store function for tab updates.
3.  **Ensure `TabsContainer` Passes Correct Props**: Verify the parent component correctly passes the `itemId` as `featureId`.
4.  **Simplify `FeatureTabContent` State and Effects**: Refactor the component to rely primarily on props for state determination.
5.  **Verify Edit Functions**: Confirm that editing uses update functions, not add functions, after the initial save.

### Step 1: Implement `updateNewTabToSavedItem` in `useTabsStore`

Add a new function to handle the transition from a temporary "new entity" tab to a persistent one linked to the saved entity:

```typescript
// In src/stores/tabs.ts

updateNewTabToSavedItem: (temporaryTabId: string, newItemId: string, newItemName: string) => {
  set((state) => {
    const updatedTabs = state.tabs.map((tab) => {
      if (tab.id === temporaryTabId) {
        // Update the tab representing the newly saved item
        return { 
          ...tab, 
          itemId: newItemId, // IMPORTANT: Link tab to the persistent item ID
          title: newItemName,
          // Potentially mark it as no longer 'new' if such a flag exists
        };
      }
      return tab;
    });

    // Ensure the updated tab remains active
    const newActiveTabId = updatedTabs.find(tab => tab.itemId === newItemId)?.id || state.activeTabId;
    
    return {
      tabs: updatedTabs,
      activeTabId: newActiveTabId, // Keep the focus on the tab
    };
  });
  // Re-activate to ensure necessary state updates/re-renders are triggered if needed
  useTabsStore.getState().activateTab(useTabsStore.getState().activeTabId); 
},
```

### Step 2: Refine `handleSaveFeature` in `FeatureTabContent` (for `isNew === true`)

Modify the saving logic for new features to correctly update the tab state via the store:

```typescript
// In src/components/feature-tab-content.tsx

const handleSaveFeature = async () => {
  if (!nameValue.trim() || !interfaceId) {
    // Basic validation
    return;
  }
  
  setIsSaving(true);
  
  try {
    // Call addFeature - Assume it returns the newly created feature object or its ID
    const newFeature = await addFeature({ // Modify addFeature if needed to return the object/ID
      name: nameValue.trim(),
      description: descriptionValue,
      priority: priorityValue,
      interfaceId: interfaceId
    });
    
    if (newFeature && newFeature.id) {
      // Use the *current* featureId prop which is the temporary tab ID
      const temporaryTabId = featureId; 
      
      // Update the tab store to link the temporary tab to the persistent feature
      updateNewTabToSavedItem(temporaryTabId, newFeature.id, newFeature.name);
      
      // Provide user feedback
      setShowSaveSuccess(true);
      setTimeout(() => setShowSaveSuccess(false), 3000); // Hide after 3 seconds

      // Do NOT manually close/re-open tabs or change URLs here.
      // The store update + prop change should handle the transition.

      // Update the parent interface if necessary (existing logic)
      updateInterfaceWithFeature(interfaceId, newFeature.id); 

    } else {
       console.error('Failed to get new feature details after saving.');
       // Handle error appropriately - show message to user
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save feature:', error);
    // Handle error appropriately - show message to user
  } finally {
    setIsSaving(false);
  }
};

// Add UI element for save success message if showSaveSuccess is true
```

### Step 3: Ensure `TabsContainer` Passes Correct Props

Verify that the `TabsContainer` component correctly reads the active tab from the `tabsStore` and passes the `itemId` property of that tab as the `featureId` prop to the `FeatureTabContent` component it renders. No specific code changes are anticipated here, just verification of the existing logic.

### Step 4: Simplify `FeatureTabContent` State and Effects

Refactor the component to rely more directly on props (`isNew`, `featureId`) and the data fetched based on `featureId` rather than complex intermediate state variables:

```typescript
// In src/components/feature-tab-content.tsx

export function FeatureTabContent({ 
  featureId, // This ID is the key. It's temporary if isNew=true, persistent otherwise.
  isNew = false,
  selectedInterfaceId 
}: FeatureTabContentProps) {
  
  // Fetch the feature based on featureId IF NOT isNew
  const { getFeatureById, /* other store functions */ } = useFeaturesStore();
  const feature = !isNew ? getFeatureById(featureId) : null; 

  // State for editable fields
  const [nameValue, setNameValue] = useState('');
  const [descriptionValue, setDescriptionValue] = useState('');
  const [priorityValue, setPriorityValue] = useState<'High' | 'Med' | 'Low'>('Med');
  const [interfaceId, setInterfaceId] = useState(selectedInterfaceId || '');
  
  // State for UI control
  const [isEditingName, setIsEditingName] = useState(isNew); // Start editing name if new
  const [isEditingDescription, setIsEditingDescription] = useState(false);
  const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);
  const [showSaveSuccess, setShowSaveSuccess] = useState(false);
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false); // For Quill

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true); // For client-side rendering checks like Quill
  }, []);

  // Effect to initialize form when featureId changes OR feature data loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (isNew) {
      // Setup for a new feature
    setNameValue('New Feature');
    setDescriptionValue('');
    setPriorityValue('Med');
    setInterfaceId(selectedInterfaceId || '');
      setIsEditingName(true); // Ensure name is editable for new features
      setIsEditingDescription(false); // Don't auto-edit description
  } else if (feature) {
      // Setup for an existing feature
    setNameValue(feature.name);
    setDescriptionValue(feature.description || '');
    setPriorityValue(feature.priority);
    setInterfaceId(feature.interfaceId);
      setIsEditingName(false); // Not editing by default
      setIsEditingDescription(false);
    } 
    // Reset saving/success states when context changes
    setIsSaving(false);
    setShowSaveSuccess(false);

  }, [featureId, isNew, feature, selectedInterfaceId]); // Dependencies cover all transitions

  // ... other handlers (handleNameSave, handleDescriptionSave, etc.) ...
  // ... JSX rendering ...
}
```
This structure relies on the `useEffect` hook reacting to changes in `featureId` (when the tab updates from temporary to persistent) or `isNew` (initial load) to correctly populate the form fields.

### Step 5: Verify Edit Functions

Ensure that the handlers for saving edits *after* the initial save (e.g., `handleNameSave`, `handleDescriptionSave`) correctly use the `featureId` prop (which is now the persistent ID) and call the appropriate *update* functions (`updateFeatureName`, `updateFeatureDescription`) in the `featuresStore`. They should **not** call `addFeature`.

```typescript
// Example: handleNameSave in FeatureTabContent
const handleNameSave = () => {
  if (!isNew && feature && nameValue.trim()) { // Ensure it's not a new feature
    updateFeatureName(featureId, nameValue.trim()); // Use the featureId prop
    updateTabTitle(featureId, 'feature', nameValue.trim()); // Update tab title too
    setIsEditingName(false);
  }
};

// Example: handleDescriptionSave in FeatureTabContent
const handleDescriptionSave = () => {
  if (!isNew && feature && descriptionValue.trim()) { // Ensure it's not a new feature
     updateFeatureDescription(featureId, descriptionValue); // Use the featureId prop
     setIsEditingDescription(false);
  }
};
```

## Testing Plan

1.  **Test New Feature Creation:**
    *   Click "Add New" -> Feature.
    *   Fill details, select Interface, click "Save Feature".
    *   **Verify:** Tab remains open, title updates to the new feature name, content area shows the saved feature details (not the "new" form), success message appears briefly.
    *   **Verify:** Feature appears correctly in the sidebar under its interface.
2.  **Test Immediate Edit After Save:**
    *   After the successful save in step 1, immediately click to edit the name in the header.
    *   Change the name and save (blur or Enter).
    *   **Verify:** Name updates in the header, tab title, and sidebar. No duplicate feature is created.
    *   Immediately click to edit the description.
    *   Change description and save.
    *   **Verify:** Description updates correctly. No duplicate feature is created.
3.  **Test Refresh/Navigation:**
    *   After saving and potentially editing, refresh the page or navigate away and back.
    *   Click the feature in the sidebar.
    *   **Verify:** The correct feature opens with the latest saved name and description.
4.  **Test Edge Cases:**
    *   Attempt to save a new feature without selecting an interface. Verify appropriate feedback/button disabled state.
    *   Attempt to save with an empty name. Verify validation prevents save.
    *   Rapidly click save multiple times. Verify only one feature is created.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  ✅ After creating a new feature, the tab automatically updates *in place* to show the newly created feature's view.
2.  ✅ The tab title changes to match the new feature's name immediately after saving.
3.  ✅ Editing a recently created feature (name, description) *updates* that feature rather than creating a duplicate.
4.  ✅ All existing functionality for feature editing (priority, etc.) continues to work.
5.  ✅ SQLite persistence functions correctly for all feature operations.
6.  ✅ The tab UI remains consistent; no jarring closing/reopening of tabs during creation.
7.  ✅ No custom components are created - only existing components are modified.
8.  ✅ Implementation uses pre-built components where possible.

## Implementation Notes

This refined implementation focuses on leveraging the store as the single source of truth for tab state and relying on the React component lifecycle (props changing triggering effects) to manage the UI transition. This avoids potentially brittle solutions involving manual state tracking or URL manipulation for the new-to-existing transition.

## Scope Management Guidelines

1.  **Stay Focused on Core Issues**: Fix the tab update and duplicate creation bug for *Features only*.
2.  **Make Incremental Changes**: Implement store changes, then component changes, testing each part.
3.  **Verify After Each Change**: Test the creation and immediate edit flow frequently.
4.  **Preserve Existing Behavior**: Other entity types (Products, Interfaces) remain unchanged.
5.  **Minimize Code Changes**: Only modify necessary logic in stores and `FeatureTabContent`.
6.  **Use Existing Patterns**: Follow established patterns in the codebase for consistency.
7.  **Document Changes Clearly**: Add comments explaining the purpose of changes, especially where behavior might not be immediately obvious.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a focused implementation that addresses exactly the identified issues without introducing unnecessary complexity or new bugs.

## Final Implementation Notes

*(This section will be updated after successful implementation)*

## Final Implementation Notes (Attempt 1 - Unsuccessful)

**Status:** FAILED

This attempt focused on resolving the issue where saving a new feature did not correctly update the tab in place, preventing immediate editing and potentially causing duplicate feature creation on subsequent edits.

**Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Modified `featuresStore`:** 
    *   Updated the `addFeature` function in `src/stores/features.ts` to return the newly created feature object (including its persistent ID), rather than `void`. This was intended to provide the necessary ID back to the saving component.
2.  **Added `tabsStore` Functionality:**
    *   Implemented a new function `updateNewTabToSavedItem` in `src/stores/tabs.ts`. This function was designed to take the temporary ID of the "new feature" tab and update its state to reflect the saved feature by setting the correct `itemId` (the persistent feature ID) and `title`, while ensuring the tab remained active.
3.  **Refactored `FeatureTabContent` (`src/components/feature-tab-content.tsx`):**
    *   The `handleSaveNewFeature` function (triggered when `isNew` is true) was modified to:
        *   Call the updated `addFeature`.
        *   On success, call `updateNewTabToSavedItem` from the tabs store, passing the temporary tab ID (received as the `featureId` prop) and the new persistent ID and name from the saved feature.
    *   State management was simplified to rely more heavily on the `featureId` and `isNew` props passed down from the `TabsContainer`.
    *   `useEffect` hooks were reviewed and adjusted to re-initialize the component's state based on changes to `featureId` or the fetched `feature` object, aiming to automatically load the saved feature data after the tab state update.
    *   Several minor linter errors and variable name inconsistencies identified during refactoring were corrected.

**Outcome:**
Despite these changes aligning with the plan, the core issue persists. The tab does not seamlessly transition from the "new feature" state to the "existing feature" view after the initial save. Users cannot immediately edit the newly saved feature within the same tab, and attempts might still lead to unexpected behavior (like triggering the save logic again).

**Notes for Next Attempt / LLM:**

*   **Goal Recap:** The primary goal of V12 is to fix the user flow for *new* feature creation. When a user clicks "Save Feature" in a new feature tab, that *same tab* should update its title and content *in place* to show the view for the feature that was just saved. The component should switch from its `isNew=true` state to `isNew=false` and display the data for the persistent `featureId`. This allows the user to immediately continue editing the description or other fields of the feature they just created without closing/reopening the tab.
*   **Persistent Issue:** The state transition mechanism is flawed. Although the stores (`features`, `tabs`) are updated, this state change isn't correctly reflected back in the `FeatureTabContent` component to make it re-render as an "existing" feature view linked to the new persistent ID.
*   **Potential Areas to Investigate:**
    *   **Tab Store Update & Activation:** Double-check if `updateNewTabToSavedItem` correctly mutates the specific tab object in the `tabs` array within the Zustand store. Is setting `activeTabId` sufficient to trigger downstream updates, or does the component rely on the `tabs` array reference changing? Is `activateTab` needed after the update?
    *   **Prop Drilling (`TabsContainer` -> `TabContent`):** Verify that the `TabsContainer` component correctly reads the updated `itemId` from the specific tab object in the `tabs` store *after* `updateNewTabToSavedItem` runs, and passes this updated `itemId` down as the `featureId` prop to `FeatureTabContent`.
    *   **Component Re-render:** Why isn't `FeatureTabContent` re-rendering correctly after the `featureId` prop theoretically changes? Are there memoization techniques (`React.memo`) in `TabsContainer` or `FeatureTabContent` preventing updates? Are the dependencies in the `useEffect` hook within `FeatureTabContent` (specifically the one that initializes state based on `feature` or `isNew`) correct to capture the transition from a temporary ID to a persistent one?
    *   **State Synchronization:** Ensure there are no race conditions or stale state issues between the Zustand store updates and the component rendering cycle.

Focus on debugging the flow: `Save Click` -> `addFeature` -> `updateNewTabToSavedItem` -> `tabsStore Update` -> `TabsContainer Re-render` -> `FeatureTabContent Re-render with new featureId prop` -> `FeatureTabContent useEffect runs` -> `Feature data loads` -> `UI updates`. Identify where this chain breaks.

## Final Implementation Notes (Successful Fix)

**Status:** SUCCESSFUL

### What Worked

- The key breakthrough was to **remove the old (temporary) tab and add a new tab with the persistent feature ID and correct type/title after saving a new feature**. This guarantees a new React key for the tab content, forcing React to fully remount the content and reset all local state.
- The `updateNewTabToSavedItem` function in the tab store was updated to:
    - Remove the tab with the temporary ID.
    - Add a new tab with the new persistent `itemId`, `title`, and `type: 'feature'`.
    - Set this new tab as the active tab.
- The `TabContent` component was already keying the content by `activeTab.itemId`, so the new tab object and key ensured the UI transitioned from the "new" feature form to the "existing" feature view after save.
- No changes were needed to the `FeatureTabContent` logic beyond ensuring it resets local state on `featureId`/`isNew` changes.

### Why Previous Attempts Failed

- Previous attempts tried to update the existing tab's `itemId` in place. However, React does not remount components if the parent array/object reference does not change, and Zustand's shallow updates may not trigger a full re-render.
- Memoization or lack of a new React key meant the component did not reset its state or re-evaluate the `isNew` prop, so the UI stayed in the "new" form even after save.
- The tab content must be keyed by the *current* `itemId` (not the tab's `id` or a static value) to ensure React treats the persistent feature as a new entity.

### Tips for Future Maintainers

- **Always key tab content by the entity's persistent ID** (e.g., `itemId`), not the tab's internal ID.
- **If you need to force a remount and state reset, remove the old tab and add a new one** with the new ID. This is the most reliable way to ensure React and Zustand are in sync.
- **Check for memoization or caching** in intermediate components that might prevent updates from propagating.
- **When debugging tab transitions, log the tab array and keys** to ensure the UI is receiving the new data and key as expected.
- **Keep acceptance criteria in mind:** The user should never see a duplicate feature, and the tab should always show the correct state after save.

This approach now meets all V12 acceptance criteria and provides a robust pattern for future tab-based entity creation flows.

# V13

## Goal
Apply the seamless tab transition fix (as in V12 for Features) to the creation flows for:
1. Products
2. Interfaces
3. Releases

Each entity will be fixed and tested in sequence. After each step, the implementation will be tested before proceeding to the next entity type.

## Acceptance Criteria
- After creating a new entity (Product, Interface, or Release), the tab automatically updates *in place* to show the newly created entity's view.
- The tab title changes to match the new entity's name.
- Editing a recently created entity updates that entity, not a duplicate.
- All existing functionality for entity creation and editing continues to work.
- SQLite persistence functions correctly for all entity operations.
- The tab UI remains consistent; no jarring closing/reopening of tabs during creation.
- No custom components are created—only existing components are modified.
- Implementation uses pre-built components where possible.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Product Creation Flow
- Update the product creation flow to use the same approach as the successful V12 fix:
    - When a new product is saved, remove the temporary tab and add a new tab with the persistent product ID and correct title/type.
    - Ensure the tab content is keyed by the product's persistent ID.
    - Test thoroughly to confirm the UI transitions from the "new" product form to the "existing" product view after save.

### Step 2: Interface Creation Flow
- After confirming the product flow works, apply the same pattern to interface creation:
    - On save, remove the temporary tab and add a new tab with the persistent interface ID and correct title/type.
    - Ensure the tab content is keyed by the interface's persistent ID.
    - Test thoroughly.

### Step 3: Release Creation Flow
- After confirming the interface flow works, apply the same pattern to release creation:
    - On save, remove the temporary tab and add a new tab with the persistent release ID and correct title/type.
    - Ensure the tab content is keyed by the release's persistent ID.
    - Test thoroughly.

## Notes
- Each step will be implemented and tested in isolation before moving to the next.
- The same acceptance criteria and best practices from V12 apply.
- Do not start implementation until the plan is reviewed and approved.

## V13 Implementation Notes (Step 1: Product Creation)

### What Was Changed
- The bug was that the product creation flow used the temporary productId (which is the itemId) to look up and replace the tab, but the tab's id is a separate value generated by the tabs store.
- The fix was to pass the tab's id (`tabId`) as a prop to `ProductTabContent` from `TabContent`, and use this `tabId` for tab replacement after save (in `updateNewTabToSavedItem`).
- This matches the working features flow, where the correct tab is always replaced after save, and the UI transitions seamlessly from the new form to the saved entity view.
- The outer container in `TabContent` is keyed by `activeTab.itemId`, and the state reset in `ProductTabContent` is triggered by `[productId, isNew, product]`.
- After this change, product creation now works as expected, just like features.

### Lessons Learned
- Always use the tab's internal id (not the itemId) for tab replacement and updates.
- The temporary itemId (e.g., 'new-product-...') is only for the new entity form; after save, always switch to the persistent entity id.
- Debug logging is invaluable for tracing the flow and confirming the correct values are being used.

---

## V13 Step 2: Interface Creation Flow

### Plan
- Apply the same fix to the interface creation flow:
    - Pass the tab's id (`tabId`) as a prop to `InterfaceTabContent` from `TabContent`.
    - Use `tabId` for tab replacement after save (in `updateNewTabToSavedItem`).
    - Ensure the outer container in `TabContent` is keyed by `activeTab.itemId`.
    - Ensure the state reset in `InterfaceTabContent` is triggered by `[interfaceId, isNew, interface_]`.
- Test thoroughly to confirm the UI transitions from the new interface form to the saved interface view after save.

- The seamless tab transition fix (originally implemented for Features in V12) was applied to Products, Interfaces, and Releases.
- When a new entity (Product, Interface, or Release) is saved, the temporary tab is replaced in-place with a new tab keyed by the persistent entity ID and correct type/title.
- The tab content is always keyed by the entity's persistent ID, ensuring React remounts the content and resets local state after save.
- The `tabId` is passed as a prop to each entity's tab content component (`ProductTabContent`, `InterfaceTabContent`, `ReleaseTabContent`), and used for tab replacement after save via `updateNewTabToSavedItem` in the tabs store.
- The save logic for each entity now:
  1. Adds the new entity to the store.
  2. Finds the new entity's persistent ID.
  3. Calls `updateNewTabToSavedItem(tabId, newEntityId, name, type)` to update the tab in-place.
- This pattern ensures a seamless UI transition from the new entity form to the saved entity view, with no jarring close/reopen or duplicate creation.

## Technical Approach
- Always use the tab's internal `id` (`tabId`) for tab replacement and updates, not the temporary itemId.
- After saving, switch from the temporary itemId (e.g., `new-product-...`) to the persistent entity ID.
- The outer container in `TabContent` is keyed by `activeTab.itemId`, so a new tab object and key ensures React remounts the content.
- All tab content components (`ProductTabContent`, `InterfaceTabContent`, `ReleaseTabContent`, `FeatureTabContent`) now accept a `tabId` prop and use it for tab replacement after save.
- The save handler for each entity finds the new entity in the store after saving, then calls `updateNewTabToSavedItem` to update the tab.

## Lessons Learned
- Keying tab content by the entity's persistent ID is essential for correct state reset and UI updates.
- Removing the old (temporary) tab and adding a new one with the persistent ID is the most reliable way to force React and Zustand to stay in sync.
- Passing `tabId` as a prop to tab content components makes the tab replacement logic robust and consistent across all entity types.
- This pattern is now the standard for all future tab-based entity creation flows.
- Debug logging and stepwise testing after each entity type ensured correctness and prevented regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ After creating a new entity, the tab automatically updates in place to show the newly created entity's view.
- ✅ The tab title changes to match the new entity's name.
- ✅ Editing a recently created entity updates that entity, not a duplicate.
- ✅ All existing functionality for entity creation and editing continues to work.
- ✅ SQLite persistence functions correctly for all entity operations.
- ✅ The tab UI remains consistent; no jarring closing/reopening of tabs during creation.
- ✅ No custom components were created—only existing components were modified.
- ✅ Implementation uses pre-built components where possible.

         - Make Featurer Page edit state controlled by the edit button in the action bar 
         - Add Delete Button to Feaures (not needed in new state since the feature has not been saved
         - If the user clicks delete: 
            open a confiration (dialog) menu to confirm and say Are you sure you? this cannot be undone with a Cancel and Delete button in the dialog
            If the user clicks delete
               - then delete the Feaure from our database
               - show a toast when the delete is successful
               - Close the tab of the now deleted feature
               - Update the side nav to reflect the deleted feature so its accurate

   - Implementation notes are added in a section below called " ## Implementation notes for V15" with lessons learned and best practices to make future development easier and reduced bugs

## Implementation Plan for V15

### Overview
This plan outlines the steps needed to restructure the Feature page layout as specified in the V15 requirements, focusing on a two-row grid layout with improved action buttons and optional requirements section.

### Core Components to Modify
1. `feature-tab-content.tsx` - Main component that needs to be restructured
2. `feature-description-editor.tsx` - Will remain mostly the same but needs placement adjustment
3. `features.ts` store - May need updates to support new requirements functionality and features can hold many requirements. Exptend the SQLite data model for features.

### Step 1: Update Layout Structure [DONE]
1. Restructure the `FeatureTabContent` component to use a two-row grid layout:
   - Head row with Feature name and Action buttons
   - Main content with Description and (optional) Requirements

2. Component structure changes:
   ```
   <FeatureTabContent>
     <HeaderSection>
       <NameColumn />
       <ActionColumn>
         <AddRequirementButton />
         <EditSaveButton />
         <CancelButton />
         <SaveButton />
       </ActionColumn>
     </HeaderSection>
     <BodySection>
       <MetadataRow>
         <PrioritySelector />
       </MetadataRow>
       <DescriptionRow>
         <FeatureDescriptionEditor />
       </DescriptionRow>
       {showRequirements && (
         <RequirementsRow>
           <RequirementsPlaceholder />
         </RequirementsRow>
       )}
     </BodySection>
   </FeatureTabContent>
   ```

### Step 2: Implement Action Bar Buttons [DONE]
1. Create conditional rendering logic for buttons:
   - "Add Requirement" button (all states)
   - "Edit" button (View/Modified states)
   - "Save" button (New/Edit states)
   - "Cancel" button (all states)

2. Implement the button click handlers:
   - Toggle requirements section visibility
   - Switch between view and edit states
   - Save feature changes
   - Cancel edits

### Step 3: Implement Delete Feature Functionality and Centralize Edit Controls

#### Part 1: Update Features Store
1. Add a new `deleteFeature` function to the Features store that:
   - Removes the feature from the features array
   - Returns success status for confirmation

#### Part 2: Create a Confirmation Dialog Component
1. Create a reusable `ConfirmationDialog` component with:
   - Title and confirmation message
   - Cancel and Confirm buttons
   - Customizable styling for different types of confirmations

#### Part 3: Remove Individual Edit Controls and Centralize Edit State
1. Update `FeatureTabContent` component to:
   - Remove inline edit controls from individual fields/elements
   - Make all editable elements read-only when not in edit mode
   - Make the name field no longer separately editable - only editable in edit mode
   - Ensure feature name field has consistent styling across modes

#### Part 4: Add Delete Feature Functionality
1. Add a delete button to the action bar (only visible in view mode for existing features)
2. Implement the delete confirmation dialog that appears when delete is clicked
3. Handle delete confirmation:
   - Delete the feature from the store
   - Close the current tab
   - Show a success toast notification
   - Trigger a refresh of the side navigation

#### Part 5: Update Side Navigation
1. Make sure the navigation store is subscribed to changes in the features store
2. Implement a refresh mechanism for the side nav when a feature is deleted

### Testing Strategy for Step 3
1. Test feature deletion flow:
   - Confirm dialog opens when delete is clicked
   - Confirm feature is removed when confirmed
   - Confirm tab closes and side nav updates
2. Test centralized edit mode:
   - Confirm all fields are read-only in view mode
   - Confirm all fields become editable in edit mode
   - Confirm edit state is properly toggled by the action bar buttons

### Dependencies for Step 3
- Shadcn UI Dialog component for confirmation dialog
- Shadcn UI Toast component for success notifications
- Zustand store updates for feature deletion
- Navigation/tabs system for tab updates and closures

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. All edit functionality is controlled from the central action bar
2. No individual edit controls on the fields (only in edit mode)
3. Delete feature capability works correctly
4. Side navigation updates after feature deletion
5. User is prompted for confirmation before deletion
6. Toast notification confirms successful deletion
7. There are no bugs in existing functionality
8. Removed code that is no longer needed

## Implementation notes for V15

### Changes Made for Steps 1 & 2
1. Updated the Feature page layout to use a two-row grid structure:
   - Header row with feature name in the first column and action buttons in the second column
   - Main content area with metadata (priority), description, and optional requirements sections

2. Extended the Feature model in the features store:
   - Added `requirements` array to store feature requirements
   - Added `showRequirements` boolean flag to track visibility state
   - Implemented CRUD operations for requirements: add, update, delete, and toggle visibility

3. Created a new RequirementsPlaceholder component:
   - Simple card-based UI to display when requirements section is toggled on
   - Shows requirement count when requirements exist
   - Shows appropriate messaging based on edit/view state

4. Implemented action buttons in the header:
   - "Add Requirement" button (visible in all states)
   - "Edit" button (visible in view/modified states)
   - "Save" button (visible in new/edit states)
   - "Cancel" button (visible in new/edit states)

5. Refactored state management:
   - Unified editing states under a single `isEditing` flag
   - Maintained separate `isEditingName` for inline name editing
   - Added local state for new features to track requirements visibility

### Changes Made for Step 3
1. Added a `deleteFeature` function to the features store:
   - Removes the feature from the features array
   - Returns a success status to confirm the deletion

2. Centralized edit functionality:
   - Removed individual edit controls from component elements
   - Consolidated all editing operations under a single edit state
   - Removed inline edit capability for feature name
   - Made all fields read-only in view mode

3. Added delete functionality:
   - Added a Delete button in the action bar (next to Edit)
   - Implemented a confirmation dialog using the existing Dialog component
   - Added dialog with warning message and red Delete button
   - Added toast notification for successful deletion

4. Updated UI behavior:
   - Feature name is now only editable when in edit mode
   - Priority is now displayed as static text in view mode
   - Interface is now displayed as static text in view mode
   - Description is no longer clickable in view mode
   - Tab is automatically closed when feature is deleted

### Technical Approach
- Used CSS Grid for layout structure to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness
- Leveraged existing Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- Implemented conditional rendering for different UI states
- Extended the Zustand store with new feature capabilities
- Used a placeholder component for requirements that can be expanded in future versions
- Used the Sonner toast library for success notifications
- Used Shadcn Dialog component for confirmation dialogs
- Simplified the component by removing redundant state

### Lessons Learned
1. **Centralized State Management**: Consolidating editing functionality under a single state variable greatly simplifies component logic and reduces potential for bugs.

2. **Declarative UI**: Using conditional rendering based on a single state flag makes the code more maintainable as the UI complexity grows.

3. **Confirmation Patterns**: Implementing a confirmation step for destructive actions (like delete) is an important UX pattern that helps prevent accidental data loss.

4. **Toast Notifications**: Using toast notifications for success/error messages provides non-intrusive feedback to the user.

5. **Side Navigation Integration**: Changes in data need to be reflected immediately in navigation to maintain UI consistency.

### Best Practices
1. Always provide visual feedback for user actions (e.g., save confirmation messages)
2. Use consistent button placement and styling across the application
3. Require confirmation for destructive actions
4. Centralize state management for related UI elements
5. Use a single source of truth for data state
6. Provide clear visual distinction between view and edit modes
7. Minimize the number of clickable elements in the UI to reduce confusion

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. Implement full requirements table with CRUD operations
2. Add sorting and filtering for requirements
3. Allow requirements to be linked to releases
4. Provide import/export functionality for requirements
5. Implement relationship visualization between features and requirements
6. Add version history or audit trail for feature changes and deletions


V16: Side nav Header changes
Requirements
- The header in the side nav should be updated to show:
   - "Specky" as the primary app name
   - An avatar using the "Proportions" icon from the Lucide icon library (https://lucide.dev/icons/proportions)
- Above "Goals" in the side nav
   - Add a welcome message above the quick links section that displays "Welcome, [user name]" where [user name] is the current logged-in user's name from the auth store
   - Remove "Changes" above goals

Acceptance Criteria
- No bugs are introduced in the application
- No existing functionality is broken during implementation
- Only pre-built components from the project are used
- Changes work consistently across all application states: New/View, Edit, Modified/Saved
- No changes are made to other entity pages that are outside the scope of this task
- Any obsolete code related to the previous header implementation is removed
- Implementation notes are added in a section below called "## Implementation notes for V16" with lessons learned and best practices to make future development easier and reduce bugs
- All changes follow existing UX patterns in the application
- Only Shadcn components are used for the implementation

## Implementation Plan for V16

### Step 1: Update Side Navigation Header

   - A welcome message that displays "Welcome, [user name]"
   - Retrieve the user's name from the auth store (useAuth hook)
   - Apply appropriate styling consistent with the application's design

### Step 3: Implement Quick Links Section
1. Create a new sidebar group below the welcome message:
   - Add a SidebarGroupLabel with the text "Quick links"
   - Populate with appropriate quick link items that are relevant to the application
   - Use existing SidebarMenu and SidebarMenuItem components for consistency

### Step 4: Testing & Cleanup
1. Test the implementation across all application states:
   - Verify the header displays correctly across all UI states
   - Ensure the welcome message correctly shows the logged-in user's name
   - Confirm quick links section displays and functions as expected

# V16: Database Storage Issues with Features

## Issue
Features were not being properly stored in the database. An investigation revealed that while the features store was correctly configured to use hybrid storage (both localStorage and SQLite), the interfaces store was only using localStorage. This incomplete hybrid storage implementation led to several problems:

1. The feature data itself was reaching the database through the `features_state` table.
2. However, the relationship between interfaces and features was stored only in localStorage via the `interfaces_state` table.
3. This relationship is managed by the `updateInterfaceWithFeature` function in the interfaces store, which updates the interface with the ID of a newly created feature.
4. Since this relationship data wasn't being persisted to the database, the connection between interfaces and features was lost after page reloads or when accessing the application from different devices/browsers.

## Fix Implemented
The solution was straightforward but critical:

1. Updated the interfaces store to use the hybrid storage mechanism instead of localStorage:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage)
   
   // To:
   storage: createHybridStorage('interfaces')
   ```

2. This change ensures that the interfaces store, including all feature relationships, is persistently stored in both localStorage and the SQLite database.

## Technical Notes
- The hybrid storage implementation (`createHybridStorage`) was already correctly set up to communicate with the API endpoint (`/api/store`).
- The SQLite database schema was properly configured with both `features_state` and `interfaces_state` tables.
- The issue was purely one of configuration - using the appropriate storage adapter for all related stores.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Relationship Consistency**: When implementing a hybrid storage pattern, ensure all related stores use the same storage mechanism to maintain relationship integrity.
2. **Data Tracing**: When troubleshooting persistence issues, it's important to trace data flow through all related stores and tables to identify inconsistencies.
3. **Consistent Configuration**: Using a uniform storage approach across related stores helps prevent data fragmentation and relationship loss.

## Best Practices
1. Always use the same storage mechanism for stores that have relationships between their entities.
2. Document the relationships between stores and how they should be configured.
3. Implement integration tests that verify relationship persistence across page reloads and database restarts.
4. Consider implementing a cascade approach to ensure that changes to relationship maps are synchronized with the database.
