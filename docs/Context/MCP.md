#What is MCP
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for managing how large language models (LLMs) interact with external data sources to provide more accurate, contextualized responses.
- Instead of relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, MCP allows the model to access and use specific data relevant to the user's query

In simple terms, MCP lets an AI model like GPT-4 or Claude:

Recognize when it needs more information
Retrieve that information from your databases or documents
Use that retrieved information to answer questions accurately

#Product Data Sources
- PRD
- UX Feedback
- Tickets
- Mocks
- Emails
- Chats
- User Feedback
- Metrics
- Launches 

#MCP in Specky
Let's Product Managers manage their features directly from LLM clients like Claude and ChatGPT. Using natural language commands, PMs can create and update product features, link documents, track approvals, and generate status reports without leaving their AI assistant. When Specky is updated, it syncs with existing tools like Jira and Figma to maintain a single source of truth, eliminating the need for manual updates across multiple platforms.

#Clients 
- Chat GPT
- Claude

#Core Services

Feature Management
    - CRUD operations for features
    - Metadata management (status, timeline, priority)
    - Relationship mapping (dependencies, parent/child)
Document Connector
    - Links PRDs to features
    - Extracts requirements from docs
    - Provides bidirectional sync
Notification Services

Query Services
    - Quick lookups like "What's the status of the checkout redesign?"
    - Timeline forecasting: "When will mobile payments ship?"
    - Dependency checking: "What's blocking the analytics dashboard?"
    - Quarter/month views: "Show me Q2 deliverables"
    - Team load balancing: "What features is the mobile team working on?"
    - Risk assessment: "What features are at risk this quarter?"

Reporting
    - Executive summaries: "Give me a status update for the leadership meeting"
    - Team progress: "How many features have we completed this quarter?"

Approval
    - Tracks who needs to approve what
    - Maintains approval history
    - Triggers re-approval when changes occur
    - Addresses the "lack of approval records" issue mentioned


Integration Hub
    - Connects to Jira/engineering tools
    - Syncs with design tools like Figma
    - Ensures alignment across disciplines


# Query Types
To start, Specky won't have much data. We'll need fetures the user can use with a LLM which require little data. These capabilities require minimal data - just your core product database with features, basic metadata, and connected documents. The key is having accurate, structured information rather than large volumes. Focus on precision over recall - it's better to return accurate but limited information
- Implement confidence scoring to clearly indicate knowledge boundaries
- Use more structured retrieval approaches (direct database lookups)


Integrations to get prodcut data. Document Integration....The connector needs to integrate with the tools PMs already use:
Supported Document Sources:
- PRDs/Strategy Doc /Notes: Google Docs, Notion, Confluence, Microsoft Word/Office 365, Plain text/Markdown files
- Aha! user feedback
- UX Mocks: Figma for UX mocks
- User Support: Zendesk, Intercom
- User reserch: Dovetail, UserTesting
- Analytics Platform - Tableau 


Basic Document Action 
- "What's a summary of PRD foo?
- Give me the requirements for PRD foo"
- "What's the launch status of Feature X?
- What is the next launch of Feature X
- What is the 
- "When is Feature Y launching?"
- How many open bugs does product X have
- Add this PRD to feature foo

Team and Ownership Tracking
- "Who owns the Analytics Dashboard feature?"
- "What features is Sarah working on?"

Document Connections
- Linking PRDs to features
- Basic requirement extraction


MCP with Growing Data Volumes
As your data grows (more documents, historical data, user interactions), you can expand to:
Mid-Stage Features:

Trend Detection

"How has our delivery timeline accuracy changed this quarter?"
"Which feature types have the most requirement changes?"


Cross-Document Insights

"Find requirements that might conflict across these three features"
"Show me all features that depend on the payment API"


Historical Context

"What was our original scope for this feature and how has it changed?"
"Show me the evolution of this requirement over time"

MCP with Rich Data (Mature Stage)
With a comprehensive data set (full product history, user feedback, market data), you can enable:
Advanced Features:

Strategic Insights

"What are our biggest product risks this quarter?"
"Which features would have the highest impact on user retention?"


Predictive Capabilities

"Based on our history, which features are likely to miss their deadlines?"
"What requirements might we be overlooking for this feature?"


Organizational Learning

"What patterns emerge from our most successful feature launches?"
"How could we improve our requirement writing process?"


#Moat
Purpose-Built PM Data Model
Unlike Jira (engineering-focused) or general AI tools:

PM-specific ontology that understands product relationships in ways engineers don't
Feature-centric rather than task-centric data model
Requirements as first-class objects with their own lifecycle and metadata

 Cross-Tool Context Integration
Your ability to connect disparate tools into a unified context:

Cross-tool relationships between PRDs, tickets, feedback, and analytics

Institutional Memory for Product Decisions
Building a system that preserves decision context:

Decision history with rationales preserved
Version control for product thinking, not just documents

 Specialized AI Understanding of Product Development
Train your AI specifically on product development patterns:
Target the PM workflow gap

Position directly against the engineering-centric nature of existing tools
Make the case that PMs deserve their own system of record

Tagging and classification 
- Manual - Add tags from the UI or LLM Client. 
- Semi Autiomatic: Folder Based Tagging, Template Detection
- Automatic:Template Detection
