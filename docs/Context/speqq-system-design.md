# Speqq.md System Design

## Overview
A tenant-level configuration system using a familiar markdown file interface where users can add their context while the system maintains hidden base instructions for quality and consistency.

## Architecture

### Instruction Composition
```
Final Instructions = Base Instructions + "\n\n--- COMPANY CONTEXT ---\n" + Speqq.md Content
```

CREATE TABLE tenant_speqq_configs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  speqq_content TEXT, -- User's Speqq.md content
