# File Explorer and Tab-Based Navigation: Implementation Plan

# Overview
This implementation follows the UX pattern of Cursor.ai, creating a seamless experience where the file tree in the left sidebar connects to tabs in the header, with a chat UI in the right panel.

# Version 1 (V1): Basic Tab Navigation

## Scope
V1 focuses exclusively on the core functionality of opening items from the file tree as tabs in the header area.

## V1 Components

1. File Tree Integration (Left Sidebar - Already Implemented)
- Hierarchical view of the product structure remains unchanged
- No new tree functionality needed beyond connecting click events to tab creation
- When a user clicks a feature/item, a new tab opens for that item

2. Basic Tab Management (Header)
- Each clicked item opens in a new tab in the header
- Tab shows item name (feature, product, etc.)
- Close button (x) on each tab
- Basic tab switching functionality
- Visual indication of the active tab

 3. Minimal Content Display (Center)
- For V1, content area may simply display the name of the selected item
- No complex content rendering required
- Clear indication of which item is being viewed

## V1 Implementation Steps

0. Remove existing header 

1. **Connect File Tree Events to Tab Creation**
   - Listen for click events on file tree items
   - Determine the clicked item's metadata (id, name, type)
   - Check if tab already exists for this item
   - If tab exists, activate it; if not, create a new tab

2. **Implement Basic Tab Bar**
   - Create a tab bar component in the header area
   - Generate tab elements based on opened items
   - Handle tab activation/deactivation
   - Implement close functionality

3. **Create Simple Content Area**
   - Display basic information about the selected item
   - Ensure content updates when tabs are switched
   - Maintain clean state between tab changes

## V1 Acceptance Criteria

- Clicking any item in the file tree creates a new tab with that item's name
- If a tab for that item already exists, it becomes active instead of creating a duplicate
- Tabs display the correct item names
- Active tab is visually distinct from inactive tabs
- Clicking on a tab makes it active and displays its associated content
- Clicking the close (x) button removes the tab
- When a tab is closed, focus shifts to the next available tab
- If all tabs are closed, the content area shows an empty or default state
- Content area clearly shows which item is currently selected
- Switching tabs correctly updates the content displayed
- Content area maintains a consistent layout regardless of selected item
- No bugs exist in the app
- App works
- Code is cleaned up if code is unused or some code becomes obsolete
- Only prebuilt components used in implementation

## Implementation Notes

- **UI Component Library**: Use Shadcn/UI for tab components to ensure consistency with the rest of the application. If Shadcn is not available, use a popular and modern alternative like Radix UI, which Shadcn is built upon.

- **Design Pattern**: Tabs should follow the existing design pattern in the application, matching color schemes, typography, and interaction patterns.

- **Data Structure**: For V1, focus only on feature-level clicks in the file tree. The expected hierarchy is Product > Interface > Features > Release, but we'll only implement feature clicks opening tabs.

- **Tree to Tab Mapping**: Each feature should have a unique identifier to prevent duplicate tabs and enable proper tab switching when the same feature is clicked again.

- **Tab State Management**: Use a simple state management approach for V1, such as React's useState or useReducer for managing the tabs array, active tab index, and basic tab operations.

- **Content Display Strategy**: For V1, the content area will display minimal information - primarily the feature name and a placeholder for future detailed content.

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Implement Tab Persistence**
   - Add localStorage saving of open tabs
   - Restore tabs on page reload
   - Maintain active tab selection between sessions

2. **Enhance Tab UX**
   - Add drag-and-drop reordering of tabs
   - Implement tab overflow handling for many open tabs
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for tab navigation

3. **Improve Content Display**
   - Create structured templates for feature content
   - Add basic metadata display for features
   - Implement loading states for content fetching

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add subtle animations for tab transitions
   - Improve visual connection between file tree and open tabs
   - Implement proper error states and empty states


# Version 2 (V2): Enhanced Functionality

### V2 Components (Future Development)

#### 1. Advanced File Tree Functionality
- Right-click context menu for quick actions
- Search functionality to quickly locate items
- Visual connection between selected file tree item and its open tab

#### 2. Enhanced Tab Management
- Tabs remain persistent between sessions
- Tab state saved and restored
- Tab reordering via drag and drop
- Tab grouping capabilities
- Tab history navigation

#### 3. Chat Interface (Right Panel)
- Context-aware AI assistant that understands the currently active tab
- Message thread UI similar to Cursor.ai
- Support for commands to generate visualizations and insights
- Ability to reference elements from the active document
- File/image attachment capabilities for sharing assets

#### 4. Rich Content Display
- Supports different content types (textual documentation, metrics, visualizations)
- Edit capabilities for supported content types
- Consistent header with breadcrumbs and key actions
- Advanced data visualization options

### V2 Implementation Priorities (Future Development)

- Tab persistence and state management
- Chat UI panel implementation
- Context-awareness between tabs and chat
- Advanced content rendering for different item types
- Cross-item linking and navigation
- Collaborative features

## Technical Considerations

### Tab Management Architecture
- Simple in-memory tab storage for V1
- No persistence requirements for V1
- Clean separation between tab state and content rendering
- Scalable architecture that can be extended in V2

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient DOM updates when switching tabs
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Ensure smooth tab creation and deletion
- Simple content placeholder strategy for V1
