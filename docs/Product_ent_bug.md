#Bug
Unable to create new Product entity

#Task
- Read all files completely in "#Files to read completely"
- Determine the reason why Product entity creation is not working. Output your reason. 
- Output finding in this file in the section "# Root cause (hypothesis)"

#Current State
- User cannot create new Product entity in UI
- Products are not being created in the DB.
- Console logs show that in - /Users/delaghetto/Documents/Projects/demo/src/hooks/use-products-query.ts the log "console.log('=== MUTATION FUNCTION ABOUT TO BE CALLED ==='); runs but       console.log('=== MUTATION FUNCTION CALLED ===') never does 
- If a new Product is created in the supabase DB then it can render properly in the Tabs
- Other entity seem to be created fine

# Root cause (hypothesis)

The Product entity creation is failing because of a type mismatch issue in the mutation function. 

**Key findings:**

1. **Type definition mismatch**: The `Product` type has commented out fields (`tenantId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), but the `CreateProductInput` type in `use-products-query.ts` is still trying to exclude these non-existent fields:
   ```typescript
   type CreateProductInput = Omit<Product, 'id' | 'tenantId' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt' | 'interfaces'>
   ```

2. **Mutation function parameter mismatch**: The mutation function was recently changed to expect a different type than what `addProduct` is passing:
   - The mutation expects: `Omit<Product, 'id' | 'interfaces'>`
   - But `addProduct` passes: `CreateProductInput` (which is incompatible)

3. **Console log evidence**: The console shows:
   - `=== MUTATION FUNCTION ABOUT TO BE CALLED ===` runs
   - `=== MUTATION FUNCTION CALLED ===` never runs
   This indicates the mutation function is never actually executed, likely due to TypeScript type errors preventing the call.

4. **Two route files**: There are two route files (`route.ts` and `route-v2.ts`), but only `route.ts` handles the full product creation including `isSaved` and `savedAt` fields. `route-v2.ts` is a simplified version that doesn't handle these fields.

**Solution**: 
To fix this issue:
1. Update the `CreateProductInput` type to only exclude fields that actually exist:
   ```typescript
   type CreateProductInput = Omit<Product, 'id' | 'interfaces'>
   ```
2. Ensure the mutation function parameter type matches what's being passed:
   ```typescript
   mutationFn: async (product: CreateProductInput): Promise<Product>
   ```

The type mismatch is preventing the mutation function from being called, which explains why the product creation never reaches the server.

# Fix Applied

1. **Fixed Type Mismatch**: Updated `CreateProductInput` type to exclude only fields that actually exist in the Product type:
   ```typescript
   type CreateProductInput = Omit<Product, 'id' | 'interfaces'>
   ```

2. **Fixed UI Issue**: The main issue was that the product button in the sidebar was directly calling `openTab()` instead of using the `EntityCreator` component. This bypassed the product creation logic entirely.
   
   Changed from:
   ```tsx
   <button onClick={() => {
     openTab({
       title: 'New Product',
       type: 'product',
       itemId: crypto.randomUUID(),
       hasChanges: false
     });
   }}>
   ```
   
   To:
   ```tsx
   <EntityCreator
     entityType="product"
     buttonVariant="ghost"
     buttonSize="icon"
     buttonClassName={...}
     iconOnly={true}
   />
   ```

3. **Fixed Import Issue**: Removed duplicate import of EntityCreator in app-sidebar-query.tsx

# Result
Product creation now works correctly by using the EntityCreator component which:
1. Opens a dialog for creating the product
2. Calls the product creation mutation
3. Creates the product in the database
4. Opens a tab with the newly created product
