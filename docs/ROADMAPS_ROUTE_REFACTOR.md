# Roadmaps DB Route Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored `/src/app/api/roadmaps-db/route.ts` to apply standardized API patterns using the new utility functions.

## Changes Applied

1. **Imports**
   - Removed `NextResponse` and `getServerSession` (no longer needed directly)
   - Added utility imports: `apiResponse`, `validateRequired`, `asyncHandler`, `getRequestContext`
   - Kept `NextRequest`, zod validation, and all service function imports

2. **GET Handler**
   - Wrapped with `asyncHandler` for automatic error handling
   - Changed from regular function to const arrow function
   - Added tenant context extraction via `getRequestContext`
   - Added tenant authorization check
   - Replaced all `NextResponse.json()` calls with `apiResponse` utilities
   - Preserved all query modes (by id, by roadmapId with features, or all)
   - Service functions already accept tenantId, so no TODOs needed
   - Removed hardcoded default tenant ('org1')

3. **POST Handler**
   - Wrapped with `asyncHandler` for automatic error handling
   - Changed from regular function to const arrow function
   - Added tenant context extraction and authorization
   - Preserved complex zod validation with preprocessing
   - Replaced all `NextResponse.json()` calls with `apiResponse` utilities
   - Kept console logging for debugging
   - Service function already accepts tenantId, so no TODO needed
   - Preserved response data formatting for client compatibility

4. **PATCH Handler**
   - Wrapped with `asyncHandler` for automatic error handling
   - Changed from regular function to const arrow function
   - Added tenant context extraction and authorization
   - Used `validateRequired(['id'])` for required field check
   - Preserved dual functionality (roadmap updates vs feature-roadmap actions)
   - Replaced all `NextResponse.json()` calls with `apiResponse` utilities
   - Service functions already accept tenantId, so no TODOs needed
   - Maintained conditional status code logic (404 vs 500)

5. **DELETE Handler**
   - Wrapped with `asyncHandler` for automatic error handling  
   - Changed from regular function to const arrow function
   - Added tenant context extraction and authorization
   - Used custom error response for missing ID
   - Replaced all `NextResponse.json()` calls with `apiResponse` utilities
   - Service function already accepts tenantId, so no TODO needed
   - Maintained conditional status code logic (404 vs 400)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Line Reduction**: Reduced from 269 lines to 207 lines (23% reduction)
2. **Consistency**: All handlers follow the same pattern
3. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplicated error handling logic
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Standardized tenant handling, removed hardcoded default
5. **Clean Architecture**: Better separation of concerns

## Special Considerations

1. **No TODOs Added**: Unlike other routes, the roadmaps service functions already accept tenantId parameter
2. **Complex Validation**: Preserved the zod preprocessing for flexible input handling
3. **Dual Functionality in PATCH**: Maintained support for both roadmap updates and feature-roadmap relationship actions
4. **Custom Status Codes**: Preserved conditional status codes based on error types (404 for not found, etc.)
5. **Response Formatting**: Kept the POST response formatting logic for client compatibility

## Notable Features

1. **Query Flexibility**: GET handler supports multiple query patterns
2. **Action-Based Updates**: PATCH handler supports both field updates and relationship actions
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Different status codes for different error scenarios
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with zod validation
