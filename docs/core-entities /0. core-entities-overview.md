# Core Entities Overview

A unified system for managing product data through Notion-style pages and blocks architecture.

## What Are Core Entities?

Core entities are the building blocks of your product management workflow:

- **Pages**: Unified container for all content types (Projects, Features, Releases, Roadmaps)
- **Blocks**: Rich content elements within pages (Documents, Requirements, Criteria)
- **Properties**: Structured metadata (Status, Priority, Dates)

## Page Types

### Project Pages
- High-level initiatives and goals
- Contains features, requirements, and documentation
- Default icon: File

### Feature Pages  
- Specific functionality or capabilities
- Tracks development progress and acceptance criteria
- Default icon: Puzzle piece

### Release Pages
- Version milestones and delivery planning
- Groups features for coordinated releases
- Default icon: Calendar

### Roadmap Pages
- Strategic planning and timeline visualization
- Links to features and releases
- Default icon: Calendar

## Entity State

Real-time synchronization keeps your data consistent across all views:

• **Instant Updates**: Changes in one location immediately reflect everywhere else
• **Unified Cache System**: Single source of truth automatically updates all components (sidebar, tabs, editor)
• **Smart Synchronization**: When you update a page, all UI elements refresh simultaneously
• **Cross-Component Sync**: Icons and titles stay perfectly synchronized between sidebar, tabs, and editor
• **Type Changes**: Switching page types updates both visual indicators and underlying data structure
• **Automatic Persistence**: All changes are saved to the database and propagated to active sessions
