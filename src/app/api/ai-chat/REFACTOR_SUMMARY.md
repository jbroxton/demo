# AI Chat Route Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored `/src/app/api/ai-chat/route.ts` to follow the new API best practices and removed all unnecessary AI database operations.

## Major Changes

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- Removed all SQLite vector operations (not being used)
- Removed all AI database table operations (tables don't exist)
- Removed indexing functionality (no longer needed)
- Streamlined to a simple chat endpoint

### 2. Applied API Best Practices
- Added imports for `apiResponse`, `asyncHandler`, and `getRequestContext`
- Wrapped POST handler with `asyncHandler` for automatic error handling
- Used `getRequestContext` to extract tenant context
- Replaced manual JSON responses with `apiResponse` utilities

### 3. Cleaner Implementation
- Removed complex embedding generation code
- Removed vector similarity search
- Removed document indexing logic
- Simplified to basic OpenAI chat streaming

### 4. Multi-Tenancy Support
- Properly extracts tenant ID from session context
- Maintains fallback chain for tenant ID resolution
- Tenant context ready for future use if needed

## Final Route Structure
The route now:
1. Validates OpenAI API key availability
2. Extracts and validates request body
3. Gets tenant context (for future use)
4. Sends messages to OpenAI with a simple system prompt
5. Returns streaming response

## Benefits
- Much simpler and cleaner code
- No unnecessary database operations
- Follows all API best practices
- Ready for multi-tenancy when needed
- Easier to maintain and debug

## Code Reduction
- Original: ~290 lines
- Refactored: ~59 lines
- **80% reduction in code complexity**
