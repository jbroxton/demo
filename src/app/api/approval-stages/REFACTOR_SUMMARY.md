# Approval Stages Route Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored `/src/app/api/approval-stages/route.ts` to follow the new API best practices using utility functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Imported New Utilities
- Added imports for `apiResponse`, `validateRequired`, `asyncHandler`, and `getRequestContext`
- These utilities standardize error handling, response formats, and context extraction

### 2. Refactored GET Handler
- Wrapped with `asyncHandler` to remove try-catch
- Used `getRequestContext` to extract searchParams and tenantId
- Added tenant authorization check
- Replaced manual JSON responses with `apiResponse.success()` and `apiResponse.error()`
- Updated to use arrow function syntax: `export const GET = asyncHandler(async ...)`
- Added TODO for updating service functions to accept tenantId

### 3. Refactored POST Handler
- Wrapped with `asyncHandler` to remove try-catch
- Used `getRequestContext` to extract body and tenantId
- Added tenant authorization check
- Added validation for required fields: `name`, `type`, `order`
- Used `validateRequired` for input validation
- Replaced manual responses with standardized utilities
- Added TODO for updating service function to accept tenantId

### 4. Refactored PUT Handler
- Wrapped with `asyncHandler` to remove try-catch
- Used `getRequestContext` to extract body and tenantId
- Added tenant authorization check
- Added validation for required field: `id`
- Replaced manual responses with standardized utilities
- Added TODO for updating service function to accept tenantId and verify ownership

### 5. Refactored DELETE Handler
- Wrapped with `asyncHandler` to remove try-catch
- Used `getRequestContext` to extract searchParams and tenantId
- Added tenant authorization check
- Improved ID extraction from searchParams
- Replaced manual responses with standardized utilities
- Added TODO for updating service function to accept tenantId and verify ownership

## TODOs Added
- Update `getApprovalStages` to accept tenantId parameter
- Update `getApprovalStageById` to accept tenantId parameter
- Update `createApprovalStage` to accept tenantId parameter
- Update `updateApprovalStage` to accept tenantId and verify ownership
- Update `deleteApprovalStage` to accept tenantId and verify ownership

## Benefits
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Standardized response formats
- Automatic error catching and logging
- Better tenant context management
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Cleaner and more maintainable code

## Code Reduction
- Original: ~125 lines
- Refactored: ~116 lines
- Cleaner structure with less nesting
- Removed all try-catch blocks
- Consistent patterns across all handlers

## Next Steps
- Update service layer functions to accept tenantId parameter
- Add tenant filtering to all database queries
- Add ownership verification for update/delete operations
- Consider adding more specific validation rules for stage types
