/**
 * DISABLED: Old Supabase Edge Function: process-embedding
 * 
 * This function processes embedding jobs from the message queue and generates
 * vector embeddings using OpenAI's API. It's designed to work with Supabase's
 * native auto-embedding system using pgmq and pg_cron.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Processes jobs from pgmq message queue
 * - Generates embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
 * - Stores embeddings in ai_embeddings table
 * - Handles failures gracefully with retry logic
 * - Multi-tenant aware
 * 
 * COMMENTED OUT TO AVOID BUILD CONFLICTS
