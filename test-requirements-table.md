# Requirements Table Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

1. **TipTap Extension** (`requirements-table-extension.ts`)
   - Creates a custom TipTap node for requirements tables
   - Configurable with `featureId` attribute
   - Renders as a block-level, non-editable element

2. **NodeView Component** (`requirements-table-nodeview.tsx`)
   - React component that renders inside the TipTap editor
   - Fetches feature data using `usePagesQuery` hook
   - Displays requirements in a table format

3. **Table Component** (`requirements-pages-table.tsx`)
   - Displays requirements as a table with columns for:
     - Title
     - Status (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
     - Priority (Low/Medium/High)
     - Jira ID with external link
     - Actions (Delete)
   - Inline editing for adding new requirements
   - Uses existing shadcn/ui components

4. **Editor Integration**
   - Added RequirementsTableExtension to the unified page editor
   - Available via "Add Block" dropdown menu (for feature pages only)
   - Available via slash command "/requirements" (for feature pages only)
   - Stored page context in editor storage for access by extensions

## How to use:

1. **Via Add Block Button**:
   - On a Feature page, click "Add Block" button
   - Select "Requirements Table" from dropdown
   - A requirements table will be inserted at the end of the document

2. **Via Slash Command**:
   - On a Feature page, type "/" in the editor
   - Type "requirements" to filter
   - Select "Requirements Table" from the menu
   - The table will be inserted at the current cursor position

## How it works:

- Requirements are stored as blocks within the page's blocks array
- Each requirement block has type: 'requirement' with properties for title, status, priority, jira_id
- The table component filters and displays only requirement-type blocks
- Changes are persisted through the existing Pages API infrastructure
- Multi-tenancy is automatically handled by the Pages system

## Next steps if needed:

1. Add more requirement fields (assignee, due date, etc.)
2. Add bulk operations (delete multiple, change status)
3. Add sorting and filtering capabilities
4. Add export functionality
5. Integration with actual Jira API
